# CSE563-Final-Project

# Save Attendance

Creates a CSV file in the root folder from the current roster and attendance information so that it can be used at a later time. It is saved with the file name "SaveAttendance.csv"

Please Note:Â If a roster is not loaded and Save Attendance has been clicked the dialog box with an error message will appear.


# Add Attendance

Once a roster is added, attendance file(s) can be uploaded. While uploading attendance make sure that all the attendance files have names in the format "YYYYMMDD attendace.csv".

Please Note: Do not add multiple attendance file for the same date as the system will think that you need to add more data for the same date and it will accumulate all the results.
